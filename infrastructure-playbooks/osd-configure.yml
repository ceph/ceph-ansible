# This playbook is used to add a new OSD to
# an existing cluster without the need for running
# the ceph-common or ceph-mon role again against all
# of the existing monitors.
#
# Ensure that all monitors are present in the mons
# group in your inventory so that the ceph.conf is
# created correctly for the new OSD.
