# This playbook is used to add a new OSD to
# an existing cluster without the need for running
# the ceph-docker-common or ceph-common and ceph-mon role again against all
# of the existing monitors.
#
# It can run from any machine. Even if the fetch directory is not present
# it will be created.
#
# Ensure that all monitors are present in the mons
# group in your inventory so that the ceph configuration file
# is created correctly for the new OSD(s).
#
# It is expected to edit your inventory file to only point to the OSD hosts
# you want to play the playbook on. So you need to comment already deployed OSD
# and let uncommented the new OSDs.
