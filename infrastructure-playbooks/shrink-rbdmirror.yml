# This playbook removes the Ceph RBD mirror from your cluster on the given
# node.
#
# Use it like this:
# ansible-playbook shrink-rbdmirror.yml -e rbdmirror_to_kill=ceph-rbdmirror01
#     Prompts for confirmation to shrink, defaults to no and
#     doesn't shrink the cluster. yes shrinks the cluster.
#
# ansible-playbook -e ireallymeanit=yes|no shrink-rbdmirror.yml
#     Overrides the prompt using -e option. Can be used in
#     automation scripts to avoid interactive prompt.
