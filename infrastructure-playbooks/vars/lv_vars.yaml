# This file configures logical volume creation for FS Journals on NVMe, a NVMe based bucket index, and HDD based OSDs.
# This playbook configures one NVMe device at a time. If your OSD systems contain multiple NVMe devices, you will need to edit the key variables ("nvme_device", "hdd_devices") for each run.
# It is meant to be used when osd_objectstore=filestore and it outputs the necessary input for group_vars/osds.yml when configured with osd_scenario=lvm.
# The LVs for journals are created first then the LVs for data. All LVs for journals correspond to a LV for data.
#
## CHANGE THESE VARS ##

# Path of nvme device primed for LV creation for journals and data. Only one NVMe device is allowed at a time. Providing a list will not work in this case.
nvme_device: /dev/nvme0n1

# Path of hdd devices designated for LV creation.
hdd_devices:
  - /dev/sdd
  - /dev/sde
  - /dev/sdf
  - /dev/sdg
  - /dev/sdh

# Per the lvol module documentation, "size" and "journal_size" is the size of the logical volume, according to lvcreate(8) --size. 
# This is by default in megabytes or optionally with one of [bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] units; or according to lvcreate(8) --extents as a percentage of [VG|PVS|FREE]; Float values must begin with a digit.
# For further reading and examples see: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/modules/lvol_module.html

# Suggested journal size is 5500
journal_size: 5500

# This var is a list of bucket index LVs created on the NVMe device. We recommend one be created but you can add others
nvme_device_lvs:
  - lv_name: "ceph-bucket-index-1"
    size: 100%FREE
    journal_name: "ceph-journal-bucket-index-1-{{ nvme_device_basename }}"

## TYPICAL USERS WILL NOT NEED TO CHANGE VARS FROM HERE DOWN ##

# all hdd's have to be the same size and the LVs on them are dedicated for OSD data
hdd_lv_size: 100%FREE

# Since this playbook can be run multiple times across different devices, {{ var.split('/')[-1] }} is used quite frequently in this play-book.
# This is used to strip the device name away from its path (ex: sdc from /dev/sdc) to differenciate the names of vgs, journals, or lvs if the prefixes are not changed across multiple runs.
nvme_device_basename: "{{ nvme_device.split('/')[-1] }}"

# Only one volume group is created in the playbook for all the LVs on NVMe. This volume group takes up the entire device specified in "nvme_device".
nvme_vg_name: "ceph-nvme-vg-{{ nvme_device_basename }}"

hdd_vg_prefix: "ceph-hdd-vg"
hdd_lv_prefix: "ceph-hdd-lv"

# Journals are created on NVMe device
