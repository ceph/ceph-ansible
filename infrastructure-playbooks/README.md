Infrastructure playbooks
========================

This directory contains a variety of playbooks that can be used independently of the Ceph roles we have.
They aim to perform infrastructure related tasks that would help use managing a Ceph cluster or performing certain operational tasks.

To use them, run `ansible-playbook infrastructure-playbooks/<playbook>`.
