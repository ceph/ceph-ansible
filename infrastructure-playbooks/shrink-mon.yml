# This playbook shrinks the Ceph monitors from your cluster
# It can remove a Ceph of monitor from the cluster and ALL ITS DATA
#
# Use it like this:
# ansible-playbook shrink-mon.yml -e mon_to_kill=ceph-mon01
#     Prompts for confirmation to shrink, defaults to no and
#     doesn't shrink the cluster. yes shrinks the cluster.
#
# ansible-playbook -e ireallymeanit=yes|no shrink-mon.yml
#     Overrides the prompt using -e option. Can be used in
#     automation scripts to avoid interactive prompt.
