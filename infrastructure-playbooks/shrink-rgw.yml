# This playbook shrinks the Ceph RGW from your cluster
#
# Use it like this:
# ansible-playbook shrink-rgw.yml -e rgw_to_kill=ceph-rgw01
#     Prompts for confirmation to shrink, defaults to no and
#     doesn't shrink the cluster. yes shrinks the cluster.
#
# ansible-playbook -e ireallymeanit=yes|no shrink-rgw.yml
#     Overrides the prompt using -e option. Can be used in
#     automation scripts to avoid interactive prompt.

          Exiting shrink-cluster playbook, no RGW was removed. On the command
          line when invoking the playbook, you can use
          "-e rgw_to_kill=ceph.rgw0 argument".  You can only remove a single
          RGW each time the playbook runs.
