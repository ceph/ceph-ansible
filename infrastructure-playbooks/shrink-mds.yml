# This playbook removes the Ceph MDS from your cluster.
#
# Use it like this:
# ansible-playbook shrink-mds.yml -e mds_to_kill=ceph-mds01
#     Prompts for confirmation to shrink, defaults to no and
#     doesn't shrink the cluster. yes shrinks the cluster.
#
# ansible-playbook -e ireallymeanit=yes|no shrink-mds.yml
#     Overrides the prompt using -e option. Can be used in
#     automation scripts to avoid interactive prompt.
