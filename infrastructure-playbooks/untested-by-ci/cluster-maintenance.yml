# This playbook was made to automate Ceph servers maintenance
# Typical use case: hardware change
# By running this playbook you will set the 'noout' flag on your
# cluster, which means that OSD **can't** be marked as out
# of the CRUSH map, but they will be marked as down.
# Basically we tell the cluster to don't move any data since
# the operation won't last for too long.
