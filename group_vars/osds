# Declare devices
# All the scenarii inherit from the following device declaration
#
devices: [ '/dev/sdb', '/dev/sdc', '/dev/sdd', '/dev/sde']


# I. First scenario: journal and osd_data on the same device
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
# This will collocate both journal and data on the same disk
# creating a partition at the beginning of the device
#
journal_collocation: true


# II. Second scenario: single journal device for N OSDs
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
#
raw_journal: false
raw_journal_device: /dev/sdb


# III. Third scenario: N journal devices for N OSDs
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
#
# In the following example:
# * sdd and sde will get sdb as a journal
# * sdf and sdg will get sdc as a journal
# While starting you have 2 options:
# 1. Pre-allocate all the devices
# 2. Progressively add new devices
