# at their disposal, some people might want to have it
# distributed on rbd-mirror nodes. Setting 'copy_admin_key' to 'true'
# will copy the admin key to the /etc/ceph/ directory. Only
# valid for Luminous and later releases.

# The name of this cluster must be different than your local cluster simply
# because we need to have both keys and ceph.conf inside /etc/ceph.
# Thus if cluster names are identical we can not have them under /etc/ceph
