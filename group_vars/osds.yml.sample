# BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS OPTION
# DO NOT USE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
#
# /!\
#
# It is probably best to keep this option to 'false' as the default
# suggests it. This option should only be used while doing some complex
# CRUSH map. It allows you to force a specific location for a set of OSDs.
#
# The following options will build a ceph.conf with OSD sections
# Example:
# [osd.X]
# osd crush location = "root=location"
#
# This works with your inventory file
# To match the following 'osd_crush_location' option the inventory must look like:
#
# [osds]
# osd0 ceph_crush_root=foo ceph_crush_rack=bar

#crush_location: false
#osd_crush_location: "'root={{ ceph_crush_root }} rack={{ ceph_crush_rack }} host={{ ansible_hostname }}'"

# Devices to be used as OSDs
# You can pre-provision disks that are not present yet.
# Ansible will just skip them. Newly added disk will be
# automatically configured during the next run.
#


# Declare devices to be used as OSDs
# All scenario(except 3rd) inherit from the following device declaration

#devices:
#  - /dev/sdb
#  - /dev/sdc
#  - /dev/sdd
#  - /dev/sde

#devices: []


#'osd_auto_discovery'  mode prevents you from filling out the 'devices' variable above.
#  You can use this option with First and Forth and Fifth OSDS scenario.
# Device discovery is based on the Ansible fact 'ansible_devices'
# which reports all the devices on a system. If chosen all the disks
# found will be passed to ceph-disk. You should not be worried on using
# this option since ceph-disk has a built-in check which looks for empty devices.
# Thus devices with existing partition tables will not be used.

# # /!\ ENABLE ONLY ONE SCENARIO AT A TIME /!\
# #
# #  !! WARNING !!
#

# I. First scenario: journal and osd_data on the same device
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
# This will collocate both journal and data on the same disk
# creating a partition at the beginning of the device
# List devices under 'devices' variable above or choose 'osd_auto_discovery'


#journal_collocation: false


# II.  Second scenario:  N journal devices for N OSDs
# Use 'true' for 'raw_multi_journal' to enable this scenario
# List devices under 'devices' variable above and 
# write journal devices for those under 'raw_journal_devices'
# In the following example:
# * sdb and sdc will get sdf as a journal
# * sdd and sde will get sdg as a journal

# While starting you have 2 options:
# 1. Pre-allocate all the devices
# 2. Progressively add new devices
#raw_multi_journal: false
#raw_journal_devices:
#  - /dev/sdf
#  - /dev/sdf
#  - /dev/sdg
#  - /dev/sdg
#
# NOTE(leseb):
# On a containerized scenario we only support A SINGLE journal
# for all the OSDs on a given machine. If you don't, bad things will happen
# This is a limitation we plan to fix at some point.
#raw_journal_devices: []


# III. Use directory instead of disk for OSDs
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario

#osd_directory: false
#osd_directories:
#  - /var/lib/ceph/osd/mydir1
#  - /var/lib/ceph/osd/mydir2
#osd_directories: []


# IV. This will partition disks for BlueStore
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
#bluestore: false


# V. Encrypt osd data and/or journal devices with dm-crypt.
# Keys are stored into the monitors k/v store
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
# Both journal and data are stored on the same dm-crypt encrypted device
#dmcrypt_journal_collocation: false


# VI. Encrypt osd data and/or journal devices with dm-crypt.
# Keys are stored into the monitors k/v store
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
# Journal and osd data are separated, each with their own dm-crypt device
# You must use raw_journal_devices and set your journal devices
