# Even though NFS nodes should not have the admin key

# service is managed by pacemaker

# ceph-nfs systemd service uses ansible's hostname as an instance id,
# so service name is ceph-nfs@{{ ansible_hostname }}, this is not
# ideal when ceph-nfs is managed by pacemaker across multiple hosts - in
# such case it's better to have constant instance id instead which
# can be set by 'ceph_nfs_service_suffix'
