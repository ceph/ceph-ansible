# Generate a keyring using ceph-authtool CLI or python.
# Eg:
#  $ ceph-authtool --gen-print-key
#  or
#  $ python2 -c "import os ; import struct ; import time; import base64 ; key = os.urandom(16) ; header = struct.pack('<hiih',1,int(time.time()),0,len(key)) ; print(base64.b64encode(header + key))"

#  - { name: client.test, caps: { mon: "profile rbd", osd: "allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children, profile rbd pool=test" },  mode: "{{ ceph_keyring_permissions }}" }
