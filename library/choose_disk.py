module: choose_disk
author: Erwan Velu <erwan@redhat.com>
short_description: Choose disks based on their features
description:
    Ceph-ansible should pass the block devices to ceph-disk.
    But what disks to consider ?
    Passing block devices by their short path (/dev/sdx) means inconsistency
    across reboots or nodes.
    Using ids (/dev/disk/by-id) is too precise as it usually embedded a
    serial number.
    The solution is using a descriptive language to define "what" we are looking
    for : then this module search for the give disks and reports their id path.
    The module works in :
    - legacy mode where the module only make a few checks but doesn't search/rename the block devices.
    - native mode where user specify what disk to search base on its features
