# NOTE (leseb):
# The playbook aims to make ceph-ansible taking over a cluster
# that was not configured with it.
#
# The procedure comes as fellow:
#
# 1. Install Ansible and add your monitors and osds hosts in it. For more detailed information you can read the [Ceph Ansible Wiki](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/wiki)
# 2. Set  `generate_fsid: false` in `group_vars`
# 3. Get your current cluster fsid with `ceph fsid` and set `cluster_fsid` accordingly in `group_vars`
# 4. Run the playbook called: `take-over-existing-cluster.yml` like this `ansible-playbook take-over-existing-cluster.yml`.
# 5. Eventually run Ceph Ansible to validate everything by doing: `ansible-playbook site.yml`.
