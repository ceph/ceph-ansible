# Ansible role: Ceph Common

This role does several things prior to bootstrapping your Ceph cluster:

* Checks the system and validates that Ceph can be installed
* Tunes the operating system if the node is an OSD server
* Installs Ceph
* Generates `ceph.conf`

# Requirements

Move the `plugins/actions/config_template.py` file to your top level playbook directory.
Edit your `ansible.cfg` like so:

    action_plugins = plugins/actions

Depending on how you are managing your playbook, the path might be different so edit the file accordingly if necessary.
