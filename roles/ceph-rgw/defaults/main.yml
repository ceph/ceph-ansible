# Declaring rgw_create_pools will create pools with the given number of pgs,
# size, and type. The following are some important notes on this automatic
# pool creation:
#   - The pools and associated pg_num's below are merely examples of pools that
#     could be automatically created when rgws are deployed.
#   - The default pg_num is 8 (from osd_pool_default_pg_num) for pool created
#     if rgw_create_pools isn't declared and configured.
#   - A pgcalc tool should be used to determine the optimal sizes for
#     the rgw.buckets.data, rgw.buckets.index pools as well as any other
#     pools declared in this dictionary.
#     https://ceph.io/pgcalc is the upstream pgcalc tool
#     https://access.redhat.com/labsinfo/cephpgc is a pgcalc tool offered by
#     Red Hat if you are using RHCS.
#   - The default value of {{ rgw_zone }} is 'default'.
#   - The type must be set as either 'replicated' or 'ec' for
#     each pool.
#   - If a pool's type is 'ec', k and m values must be set via
#     the ec_k, and ec_m variables.
#   - The rule_name key can be used with a specific crush rule value (must exist).
#     If the key doesn't exist it falls back to the default replicated_rule.
#     This only works for replicated pool type not erasure.
