# default, the playbook generates one for you and stores it in a file
# in `fetch_directory`. If you want to customize how the fsid is
# generated, you may find it useful to disable fsid generation to
# avoid cluttering up your ansible repo. If you set `generate_fsid` to
# false, you *must* generate `fsid` in another way.
