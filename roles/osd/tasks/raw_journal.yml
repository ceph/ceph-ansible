## SCENARIO 2: SINGLE JOURNAL DEVICE FOR N OSDS

- name: Install dependancies
  apt: pkg=parted state=present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: Install dependancies
  yum: name=parted state=present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'

- name: Copy OSD bootstrap key
  copy: src=fetch/{{ fsid }}/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/ceph.keyring dest=/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/ceph.keyring owner=root group=root mode=600
  when: cephx

# NOTE (leseb): current behavior of ceph-disk is to fail when the device is mounted "stderr: ceph-disk: Error: Device is mounted: /dev/sdb1"
# the return code is 1, which makes sense, however ideally if ceph-disk will detect a ceph partition
# it should exist we rc=0 and don't do anything unless we do something like --force
# As as a final word, I prefer to keep the partition check instead of running ceph-disk prepare with "ignore_errors: True"
# I believe it's safer
#

- name: If partition named 'ceph' exists
  shell: parted --script {{ item }} print | egrep -sq '^ 1.*ceph'
  ignore_errors: True
  with_items: devices
  register: parted
  changed_when: False

# Prepare means
# - create GPT partition
# - mark the partition with the ceph type uuid
# - create a file system
# - mark the fs as ready for ceph consumption
# - entire data disk is used (one big partition)
# - a new partition is added to the journal disk (so it can be easily shared)
#

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop

- name: Prepare OSD disk(s)
  command: ceph-disk prepare {{ item.1 }} {{ raw_journal_device }}
  when: item.0.rc != 0 and raw_journal
  ignore_errors: True
  with_together:
    - parted.results
    - devices

# Activate means:
# - mount the volume in a temp location
# - allocate an osd id (if needed)
# - remount in the correct location /var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id
# - start ceph-osd
#

- name: Activate OSD(s)
  command: ceph-disk activate {{ item }}1
  with_items: devices
  ignore_errors: True
  changed_when: False

- name: Start and add that the OSD service to the init sequence
