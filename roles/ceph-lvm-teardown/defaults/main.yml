# Since this playbook can be run multiple times across different devices, {{ var.split('/')[-1] }} is used quite frequently in this play-book.
# This is used to strip the device name away from its path (ex: sdc from /dev/sdc) to differenciate the names of vgs, journals, or lvs if the prefixes are not changed across multiple runs.
nvme_device_basename: "{{ nvme_device.split('/')[-1] }}"
# Only one volume group is created in the playbook for all the LVs on NVMe. This volume group takes up the entire device specified in "nvme_device".
