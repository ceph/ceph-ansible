# CEPH CONFIGURATION #
######################

## Ceph options
#
# Each cluster requires a unique, consistent filesystem ID. By
# default, the playbook generates one for you and stores it in a file
# in `fetch_directory`. If you want to customize how the fsid is
# generated, you may find it useful to disable fsid generation to
# avoid cluttering up your ansible repo. If you set `generate_fsid` to
# false, you *must* generate `fsid` in another way.
# ACTIVATE THE FSID VARIABLE FOR NON-VAGRANT DEPLOYMENT
fsid: "{{ cluster_uuid.stdout }}"
generate_fsid: true

ceph_conf_key_directory: /etc/ceph

cephx: true

## Client options
#
rbd_cache: "true"
rbd_cache_writethrough_until_flush: "true"
rbd_concurrent_management_ops: 20

rbd_client_directories: true # this will create rbd_client_log_path and rbd_client_admin_socket_path directories with proper permissions

# Permissions for the rbd_client_log_path and
# rbd_client_admin_socket_path. Depending on your use case for Ceph
# you may want to change these values. The default, which is used if
# any of the variables are unset or set to a false value (like `null`
# or `false`) is to automatically determine what is appropriate for
# the Ceph version with non-OpenStack workloads -- ceph:ceph and 0770
# for infernalis releases, and root:root and 1777 for pre-infernalis
# releases.
#
# For other use cases, including running Ceph with OpenStack, you'll
# want to set these differently:
#
# For OpenStack on RHEL, you'll want:
#   rbd_client_directory_owner: "qemu"
#   rbd_client_directory_group: "libvirtd" (or "libvirt", depending on your version of libvirt)
#   rbd_client_directory_mode: "0755"
#
# For OpenStack on Ubuntu or Debian, set:
#    rbd_client_directory_owner: "libvirt-qemu"
#    rbd_client_directory_group: "kvm"
#    rbd_client_directory_mode: "0755"
#
# If you set rbd_client_directory_mode, you must use a string (e.g.,
# 'rbd_client_directory_mode: "0755"', *not*
# 'rbd_client_directory_mode: 0755', or Ansible will complain: mode
# must be in octal or symbolic form

## Monitor options
#
# You must define either monitor_interface, monitor_address or monitor_address_block.
# These variables must be defined at least in all.yml and overrided if needed (inventory host file or group_vars/*.yml).
# Eg. If you want to specify for each monitor which address the monitor will bind to you can set it in your **inventory host file** by using 'monitor_address' variable.
# Preference will go to monitor_address if both monitor_address and monitor_interface are defined.
# To use an IPv6 address, use the monitor_address setting instead (and set ip_version to ipv6)

## Handlers - restarting daemons after a config change
# if for whatever reasons the content of your ceph configuration changes
# ceph daemons will be restarted as well. At the moment, we can not detect
# which config option changed so all the daemons will be restarted. Although
# this restart will be serialized for each node, in between a health check
# will be performed so we make sure we don't move to the next node until
# ceph is not healthy
# Obviously between the checks (for monitors to be in quorum and for osd's pgs
# to be clean) we have to wait. These retries and delays can be configurable
# for both monitors and osds.
