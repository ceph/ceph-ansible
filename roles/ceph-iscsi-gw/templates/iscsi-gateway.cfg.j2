# API settings.
# The API supports a number of options that allow you to tailor it to your
# local environment. If you want to run the API under https, you will need to
# create cert/key files that are compatible for each iSCSI gateway node, that is
# not locked to a specific node. SSL cert and key files *must* be called
# 'iscsi-gateway.crt' and 'iscsi-gateway.key' and placed in the '/etc/ceph/' directory
# on *each* gateway node. With the SSL files in place, you can use 'api_secure = true'
# to switch to https mode.

# To support the API, the bear minimum settings are:
api_secure = {{ api_secure }}

# Optional settings related to the CLI/API service
