features:
  - The `config_template` action plugin will now search for options within a
    given section that may be commented within an INI file, and if a an option is
    following the OSLO config pattern, '#OPTION_KEY...' pattern, `config_template`
    will insert the override one line after the comment. This provides operators
    the ability to see in service options and any comments regarding the option
    within the configuration file on-disk.
