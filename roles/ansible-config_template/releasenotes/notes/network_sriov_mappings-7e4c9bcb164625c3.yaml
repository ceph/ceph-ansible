        - The new provider network attribute ``sriov_host_interfaces``
          is added to support SR-IOV network mappings inside Neutron.
          The provider_network adds new items network_sriov_mappings
          and network_sriov_mappings_list to the provider_networks
          dictionary.
          Multiple interfaces can be defined by comma separation.
