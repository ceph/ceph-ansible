features:
  - The deployer can now define an environment variable
    ``GROUP_VARS_PATH`` with the folders of its choice
    (separated by the colon sign) to define an user
    space group_vars folder. These vars will apply but
    be (currently) overriden by the OpenStack-Ansible
    default group vars, by the set facts, and by the
    user_* variables. If the deployer defines multiple
    paths, the variables found are merged, and
    precedence is increasing from left to right
    (the last defined in GROUP_VARS_PATH wins)
  - The deployer can now define an environment variable
    ``HOST_VARS_PATH`` with the folders of its choice
    (separated by the colon sign) to define an user
    space host_vars folder. These vars will apply but
    be (currently) overriden by the OpenStack-Ansible
    default host vars, by the set facts, and by the
    user_* variables. If the deployer defines multiple
    paths, the variables found are merged, and
    precedence is increasing from left to right
    (the last defined in HOST_VARS_PATH wins)
