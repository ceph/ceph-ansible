  - The ``py_pkgs`` lookup plugin now has strict ordering for requirement files
    discovered. These files are used to add additional requirements to the
    python packages discovered. The order is defined by the constant,
    ``REQUIREMENTS_FILE_TYPES`` which contains the following entries,
    'test-requirements.txt', 'dev-requirements.txt', 'requirements.txt',
    'global-requirements.txt', 'global-requirement-pins.txt'. The items in this
    list are arranged from least to most priority.
