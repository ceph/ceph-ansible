features:
  - Option parsing in `config_template` has been extended to allow for array
    only overrides. This enhancement will allow us to ingest files which
    contain only an array. For this work, the `config_overrides` now accepts
    both a hash and an array, and will merge, replace, or extend based on the
    data-type.
