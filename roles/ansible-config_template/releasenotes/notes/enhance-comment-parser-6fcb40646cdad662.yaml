features:
  - Config template comment parser will now respect all comments and spacing
    throughout INI files. This will allow us to use OSLO config to generate
    files which contain commentary about the various defaults. This enhancement
    will allow operators to benefit from deployer comments and system commentary
    all from within the on-disk files while keeping all of the flexibility the
    `config_template` action plugin provides.
