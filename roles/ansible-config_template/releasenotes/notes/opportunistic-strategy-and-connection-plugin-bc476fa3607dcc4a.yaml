features:
  - An opportunistic Ansible execution strategy has been implemented. This
    allows the Ansible linear strategy to skip tasks with conditionals faster
    by never queuing the task when the conditional is evaluated to be false.
  - The Ansible SSH plugin has been modified to support running commands within
    containers without having to directly ssh into them. The change will detect
    presence of a container. If a container is found the physical host will be
    used as the SSH target and commands will be run directly. This will improve
    system reliability and speed while also opening up the possibility for SSH
    to be disabled from within the container itself.
