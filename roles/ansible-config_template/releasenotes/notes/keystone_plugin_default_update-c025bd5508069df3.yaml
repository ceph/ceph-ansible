features:
  - The default behaviour of ``ensure_endpoint`` in the
    keystone module has changed to update an existing
    endpoint, if one exists that matches the service
    name, type, region and interface. This ensures that
    no duplicate service entries can exist per region.
deprecations:
  - The ``update`` state for the ``ensure_endpoint``
    method of the ``keystone`` module is now deprecated,
    and will be removed in the Queens cycle. Setting
    state to ``present`` will achieve the same result.
