## SCENARIO 3: N JOURNAL DEVICES FOR N OSDS

- include: zap_devices.yml
- include: check_devices.yml

# Prepare means
# - create GPT partition for a disk, or a loop label for a partition
# - mark the partition with the ceph type uuid
# - create a file system
# - mark the fs as ready for ceph consumption
# - entire data disk is used (one big partition)
# - a new partition is added to the journal disk (so it can be easily shared)
#

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop

# NOTE (alahouze): if the device is a partition, the parted command below has
# failed, this is why we check if the device is a partition too.
