## SCENARIO 1: JOURNAL AND OSD_DATA ON THE SAME DEVICE

- include: zap_devices.yml
- include: check_devices.yml

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop

# NOTE (alahouze): if the device is a partition, the parted command below has
# failed, this is why we check if the device is a partition too.
