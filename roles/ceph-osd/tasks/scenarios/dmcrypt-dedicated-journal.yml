## SCENARIO 6: DMCRYPT N JOURNAL DEVICES FOR N OSDS

- include: ../check_devices.yml

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop

# NOTE (alahouze): if the device is a partition, the parted command below has
# failed, this is why we check if the device is a partition too.
- name: prepare dmcrypt osd disk(s) with a dedicated journal device
  command: "ceph-disk prepare --dmcrypt --cluster {{ cluster }} {{ item.2 }} {{ item.3 }}"
  with_together:
    - "{{ legacy_devices }}"
    - "{{ journal_devices }}"
  changed_when: false
  when:
    - not osd_auto_discovery
    - dmcrypt_dedicated_journal
