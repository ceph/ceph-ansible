## SCENARIO 5: DMCRYPT

- include: ../check_devices.yml

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop

# NOTE (alahouze): if the device is a partition, the parted command below has
# failed, this is why we check if the device is a partition too.
- name: automatic prepare dmcrypt osd disk(s) without partitions with collocated osd data and journal
  command: ceph-disk prepare --dmcrypt --cluster "{{ cluster }}" "{{ item }}"
  with_items: "{{ legacy_devices }}"

    - dmcrypt_journal_collocation
    - osd_auto_discovery

- name: manually prepare dmcrypt osd disk(s) with collocated osd data and journal
