# NOTE (leseb): current behavior of ceph-disk is to fail when the device is mounted "stderr: ceph-disk: Error: Device is mounted: /dev/sdb1"
# the return code is 1, which makes sense, however ideally if ceph-disk will detect a ceph partition
# it should exist we rc=0 and don't do anything unless we do something like --force
# As as a final word, I prefer to keep the partition check instead of running ceph-disk prepare with "ignore_errors: True"
# I believe it's safer
