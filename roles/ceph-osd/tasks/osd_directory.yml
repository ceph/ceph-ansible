## SCENARIO 4: USE A DIRECTORY INSTEAD OF A DISK FOR OSD

# NOTE (leseb): we do not check the filesystem underneath the directory
# so it is really up to you to configure this properly.
# Declaring more than one directory on the same filesystem will confuse Ceph.

- name: Create OSD directories
  file: >
    path={{ item }}
    state=directory
    owner=root
    group=root
  with_items: osd_directories

# Prepare means
# - create GPT partition
# - mark the partition with the ceph type uuid
# - create a file system
# - mark the fs as ready for ceph consumption
# - entire data disk is used (one big partition)
# - a new partition is added to the journal disk (so it can be easily shared)
#

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop

- name: Prepare OSD disk(s)
  command: "ceph-disk prepare {{ item }}"
  when: osd_directory
  with_items: osd_directories

# Activate means:
# - mount the volume in a temp location
# - allocate an osd id (if needed)
# - remount in the correct location /var/lib/ceph/osd/$cluster-$id
# - start ceph-osd
#

- name: Activate OSD(s)
  command: "ceph-disk activate {{ item }}"
  with_items: osd_directories
  changed_when: False

- name: Start and add that the OSD service to the init sequence
  service: >
    name=ceph
    state=started
    enabled=yes
