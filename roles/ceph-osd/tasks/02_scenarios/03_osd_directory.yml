## SCENARIO 4: USE A DIRECTORY INSTEAD OF A DISK FOR OSD

# NOTE (leseb): we do not check the filesystem underneath the directory
# so it is really up to you to configure this properly.
# Declaring more than one directory on the same filesystem will confuse Ceph.
- name: create osd directories
  file:
    path: "{{ item }}"
    state: directory
    owner: root
    group: root
  with_items: osd_directories

# NOTE (leseb): the prepare process must be parallelized somehow...
# if you have 64 disks with 4TB each, this will take a while
# since Ansible will sequential process the loop
- name: prepare OSD disk(s)
  command: "ceph-disk prepare {{ item }}"
  with_items: osd_directories
  changed_when: false
  when: osd_directory

- name: activate OSD(s)
  command: "ceph-disk activate {{ item }}"
  with_items: osd_directories
  changed_when: false

- name: start and add that the OSD service to the init sequence
  service:
    name: ceph
    state: started
    enabled: yes
