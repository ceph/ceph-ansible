#'osd_auto_discovery'  mode prevents you from filling out the 'devices' variable above.
# Device discovery is based on the Ansible fact 'ansible_devices'
# which reports all the devices on a system. If chosen, all the disks
# found will be passed to ceph-volume lvm batch. You should not be worried on using
# this option since ceph-volume has a built-in check which looks for empty devices.
# Thus devices with existing partition tables will not be used.

# Use ceph-volume to create OSDs from logical volumes.
# lvm_volumes is a list of dictionaries.
#
# Filestore: Each dictionary must contain a data, journal and vg_name key. Any
# logical volume or logical group used must be a name and not a path.  data
# can be a logical volume, device or partition. journal can be either a lv or partition.
# You can not use the same journal for many data lvs.
# data_vg must be the volume group name of the data lv, only applicable when data is an lv.
# journal_vg is optional and must be the volume group name of the journal lv, if applicable.
# For example:
# lvm_volumes:
#   - data: data-lv1
#     data_vg: vg1
#     journal: journal-lv1
#     journal_vg: vg2
#     crush_device_class: foo
#   - data: data-lv2
#     journal: /dev/sda1
#     data_vg: vg1
#   - data: data-lv3
#     journal: /dev/sdb1
#     data_vg: vg2
#   - data: /dev/sda
#     journal: /dev/sdb1
#   - data: /dev/sda1
#     journal: /dev/sdb1
#
# Bluestore: Each dictionary must contain at least data. When defining wal or
# db, it must have both the lv name and vg group (db and wal are not required).
# This allows for four combinations: just data, data and wal, data and wal and
# db, data and db.
# For example:
# lvm_volumes:
#   - data: data-lv1
#     data_vg: vg1
#     wal: wal-lv1
#     wal_vg: vg1
#     crush_device_class: foo
#   - data: data-lv2
#     db: db-lv2
#     db_vg: vg2
#   - data: data-lv3
#     wal: wal-lv1
#     wal_vg: vg3
#     db: db-lv3
#     db_vg: vg3
#   - data: data-lv4
#     data_vg: vg4
