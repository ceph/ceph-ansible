# It is probably best to keep this option to 'false' as the default
# suggests it. This option should only be used while doing some complex
# CRUSH map. It allows you to force a specific location for a set of OSDs.
#
# The following options will build a ceph.conf with OSD sections
# Example:
# [osd.X]
# osd crush location = "root=location"
#
# This works with your inventory file
# To match the following 'osd_crush_location' option the inventory must look like:
#
# [osds]
# osd0 ceph_crush_root=foo ceph_crush_rack=bar

# Device discovery is based on the Ansible fact 'ansible_devices'
# which reports all the devices on a system. If chosen all the disks
# found will be passed to ceph-disk. You should not be worried on using
# this option since ceph-disk has a built-in check which looks for empty devices.
# Thus devices with existing partition tables will not be used.

# I. First scenario: journal and osd_data on the same device

# write journal devices for those under 'raw_journal_devices'
# In the following example:
# * sdb and sdc will get sdf as a journal
# * sdd and sde will get sdg as a journal

# While starting you have 2 options:
# 1. Pre-allocate all the devices
# 2. Progressively add new devices

# Use 'true' to enable this scenario

#  - /var/lib/ceph/osd/mydir2


# IV. This will partition disks for BlueStore

# V. Encrypt osd data and/or journal devices with dm-crypt.
# Keys are stored into the monitors k/v store
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
# Both journal and data are stored on the same dm-crypt encrypted device
dmcrypt_journal_collocation: false


# VI. Encrypt osd data and/or journal devices with dm-crypt.
# Keys are stored into the monitors k/v store
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
