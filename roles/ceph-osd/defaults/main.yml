# Ansible will just skip them. Newly added disk will be

# Declare devices to be used as OSDs
# All scenario(except 3rd) inherit from the following device declaration
# Note: This scenario uses the ceph-disk tool to provision OSDs

#  - /dev/sdb
#  - /dev/sdc
#  - /dev/sdd
#  - /dev/sde

devices: []


#'osd_auto_discovery'  mode prevents you from filling out the 'devices' variable above.
# Device discovery is based on the Ansible fact 'ansible_devices'
# which reports all the devices on a system. If chosen all the disks
# found will be passed to ceph-disk. You should not be worried on using
# this option since ceph-disk has a built-in check which looks for empty devices.
# Thus devices with existing partition tables will not be used.
#
osd_auto_discovery: false

# Encrypt your OSD device using dmcrypt
# If set to True, no matter which osd_objecstore and osd_scenario you use the data will be encrypted
dmcrypt: False


# I. First scenario: collocated
#
# To enable this scenario do: osd_scenario: collocated
#
#
# If osd_objectstore: filestore is enabled both 'ceph data' and 'ceph journal' partitions
# will be stored on the same device.
#
# If osd_objectstore: bluestore is enabled 'ceph data', 'ceph block', 'ceph block.db', 'ceph block.wal' will be stored
# on the same device. The device will get 2 partitions:
# - One for 'data', called 'ceph data'
# - One for 'ceph block', 'ceph block.db', 'ceph block.wal' called 'ceph block'
#
# Example of what you will get:
# [root@ceph-osd0 ~]# blkid /dev/sda*
# /dev/sda: PTTYPE="gpt"
# /dev/sda1: UUID="9c43e346-dd6e-431f-92d8-cbed4ccb25f6" TYPE="xfs" PARTLABEL="ceph data" PARTUUID="749c71c9-ed8f-4930-82a7-a48a3bcdb1c7"
# /dev/sda2: PARTLABEL="ceph block" PARTUUID="e6ca3e1d-4702-4569-abfa-e285de328e9d"
#
# Note: This scenario uses the ceph-disk tool to provision OSDs

osd_scenario: dummy
valid_osd_scenarios:
  - collocated
  - non-collocated
  - lvm


# II.  Second scenario: non-collocated
#
# To enable this scenario do: osd_scenario: non-collocated
#
# If osd_objectstore: filestore is enabled 'ceph data' and 'ceph journal' partitions
# will be stored on different devices:
# - 'ceph data' will be stored on the device listed in 'devices'
# - 'ceph journal' will be stored on the device listed in 'dedicated_devices'
#
# Let's take an example, imagine 'devices' was declared like this:
#
# devices:
#   - /dev/sda
#   - /dev/sdb
#   - /dev/sdc
#   - /dev/sdd
#
# And 'dedicated_devices' was declared like this:
#
# dedicated_devices:
#   - /dev/sdf
#   - /dev/sdf
#   - /dev/sdg
#   - /dev/sdg
#
# This will result in the following mapping:
# - /dev/sda will have /dev/sdf1 as a journal
# - /dev/sdb will have /dev/sdf2 as a journal
# - /dev/sdc will have /dev/sdg1 as a journal
# - /dev/sdd will have /dev/sdg2 as a journal
#
#
# If osd_objectstore: bluestore is enabled, both 'ceph block.db' and 'ceph block.wal' partitions will be stored
# on a dedicated device.
#
# So the following will happen:
# - The devices listed in 'devices' will get 2 partitions, one for 'block' and one for 'data'.
# 'data' is only 100MB big and do not store any of your data, it's just a bunch of Ceph metadata.
# 'block' will store all your actual data.
# - The devices in 'dedicated_devices' will get one partition for RocksDB DB, called 'block.db'
#  and one for RocksDB WAL, called 'block.wal'. To use a single partition for RocksDB and WAL together
#  set bluestore_wal_devices to [].
#
# By default dedicated_devices will represent block.db
#
# Example of what you will get:
# [root@ceph-osd0 ~]# blkid /dev/sd*
# /dev/sda: PTTYPE="gpt"
# /dev/sda1: UUID="c6821801-2f21-4980-add0-b7fc8bd424d5" TYPE="xfs" PARTLABEL="ceph data" PARTUUID="f2cc6fa8-5b41-4428-8d3f-6187453464d0"
# /dev/sda2: PARTLABEL="ceph block" PARTUUID="ea454807-983a-4cf2-899e-b2680643bc1c"
# /dev/sdb: PTTYPE="gpt"
# /dev/sdb1: PARTLABEL="ceph block.db" PARTUUID="af5b2d74-4c08-42cf-be57-7248c739e217"
#
# Note: This scenario uses the ceph-disk tool to provision OSDs
dedicated_devices: []


# More device granularity for Bluestore
#
# ONLY if osd_objectstore: bluestore is enabled.
#
# By default, if 'bluestore_wal_devices' is empty.
# If set, then you will have a dedicated partition on a specific device for block.wal.
#
# Set bluestore_wal_devices: [] to use the same partition for RocksDB and WAL.
#
# Example of what you will get:
# [root@ceph-osd0 ~]# blkid /dev/sd*
# /dev/sda: PTTYPE="gpt"
# /dev/sda1: UUID="39241ae9-d119-4335-96b3-0898da8f45ce" TYPE="xfs" PARTLABEL="ceph data" PARTUUID="961e7313-bdb7-49e7-9ae7-077d65c4c669"
# /dev/sda2: PARTLABEL="ceph block" PARTUUID="bff8e54e-b780-4ece-aa16-3b2f2b8eb699"
# /dev/sdb: PTTYPE="gpt"
# /dev/sdb1: PARTLABEL="ceph block.db" PARTUUID="0734f6b6-cc94-49e9-93de-ba7e1d5b79e3"
# /dev/sdc: PTTYPE="gpt"
# /dev/sdc1: PARTLABEL="ceph block.wal" PARTUUID="824b84ba-6777-4272-bbbd-bfe2a25cecf3"

# III. Use ceph-volume to create OSDs from logical volumes.
# Use 'osd_scenario: lvm' to enable this scenario.
# when using lvm, not collocated journals.
# lvm_volumes is a list of dictionaries.
#
# Filestore: Each dictionary must contain a data, journal and vg_name key. Any
# logical volume or logical group used must be a name and not a path.  data
# can be a logical volume, device or partition. journal can be either a lv or partition.
# You can not use the same journal for many data lvs.
# data_vg must be the volume group name of the data lv, only applicable when data is an lv.
# journal_vg is optional and must be the volume group name of the journal lv, if applicable.
# For example:
# lvm_volumes:
#   - data: data-lv1
#     data_vg: vg1
#     journal: journal-lv1
#     journal_vg: vg2
#     crush_device_class: foo
#   - data: data-lv2
#     journal: /dev/sda1
#     data_vg: vg1
#   - data: data-lv3
#     journal: /dev/sdb1
#     data_vg: vg2
#   - data: /dev/sda
#     journal: /dev/sdb1
#   - data: /dev/sda1
#     journal: /dev/sdb1
#
# Bluestore: Each dictionary must contain at least data. When defining wal or
# db, it must have both the lv name and vg group (db and wal are not required).
# This allows for four combinations: just data, data and wal, data and wal and
# db, data and db.
# For example:
# lvm_volumes:
#   - data: data-lv1
#     data_vg: vg1
#     wal: wal-lv1
#     wal_vg: vg1
#     crush_device_class: foo
#   - data: data-lv2
#     db: db-lv2
#     db_vg: vg2
#   - data: data-lv3
#     wal: wal-lv1
#     wal_vg: vg3
#     db: db-lv3
#     db_vg: vg3
#   - data: data-lv4
#     data_vg: vg4
#   - data: /dev/sda
#   - data: /dev/sdb1
