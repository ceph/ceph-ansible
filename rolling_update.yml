# This playbook does a rolling update for all the Ceph services
# Change the value of serial: to adjust the number of server to be updated.
#
# The four roles that apply to the ceph hosts will be applied: ceph-common,
# ceph-mon, ceph-osd and ceph-mds. So any changes to configuration, package updates, etc,
# will be applied as part of the rolling update process.
#

# /!\ DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE THE RELEASE VERSION FIRST! /!\
