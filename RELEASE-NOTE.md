Deprecation warnings and incoming removal

Major changes from stable-3.2
-----------------------------

* Updating the Ceph ISCSI major version from 2.x to 3.x.
* Beast is the default radosgw frontend instead of Civetweb.
* Due to ceph-disk removal then there’s no collocated and non-collocated OSD scenarios anymore. The default scenario is always lvm (ceph-volume) which can be used with or without the batch mode.

Notable changes from stable-3.2
-------------------------------

* Updating the NFS Ganesha minor version from V2.7 to V2.8.
* The ceph-docker role has been split into two different roles: ceph-container-engine and ceph-container-common.
